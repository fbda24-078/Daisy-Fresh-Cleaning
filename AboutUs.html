            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Daisy Fresh Cleaning began with one man, a mop, and a dream. In 2011, our founder, Phenyo, noticed a gap in the local market for dependable, detail-oriented cleaning services. With a passion for cleanliness and a strong work ethic, he decided to start small — offering cleaning services to neighbors, friends, and small offices in Francistown.</p>

            <p>What started as a side hustle quickly grew through word-of-mouth. Phenyo’s commitment to excellence, punctuality, and trustworthy service made Daisy Fresh Cleaning a household name. From scrubbing tiles to revitalizing carpets, his hands-on approach and friendly demeanor left a lasting impression on every client.</p>

            <p>Over the years, Daisy Fresh evolved into a fully-fledged cleaning company serving both residential and commercial clients across Botswana. Despite the growth, we’ve never lost our personal touch. Every cleaner on our team shares Phenyo’s original values — integrity, consistency, and care in every job.</p>

            <p>Today, Daisy Fresh Cleaning is proud to be a family-oriented business. We treat every space we clean as if it were our own, and every customer like family. Whether it’s a weekly home clean, a post-renovation scrub-down, or a deep office refresh, we go above and beyond to make your environment shine.</p>

            <h2>Our Values</h2>
            <p>We believe that true success is built on trust and community. That’s why we live by these core values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality:</strong> We take pride in doing the job right the first time.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> You can count on us to show up, deliver, and exceed expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect:</strong> We treat your space and privacy with the utmost respect.</li>
                <li><strong>Community:</strong> We support local causes and believe in giving back.</li>
            </ul>
